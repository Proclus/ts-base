# ts-mixin-layers
TypeScript class inheritance with mixin layers

## Motivation

This project is based on [Implementing Layered Designs with Mixin Layers - Smaragdakis, Batory (1998)](https://yanniss.github.io/templates.pdf) (12th European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, ECOOP '98) which explores a new architectural 
design pattern for object oriented programming. The proposed new layered approach to class interitance involves a collaboration-based design (almost) perfectly fitting
GUI application implementation with TypeScript.
